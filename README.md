## Development Process
The development involved initial prototyping on a breadboard, with iterative coding and testing phases. Features developed include:
- Motion-activated lighting
- Sound-responsive light adjustment
- Temperature-based color change
The final design was assembled on a stripboard with a custom laser-cut enclosure.

## Product Features
- **Adaptive Brightness**: Auto-adjusts based on ambient light levels.
- **Motion-Activated Lighting**: Responds to occupancy for energy efficiency.
- **Color Temperature Adjustment**: Changes hues with room temperature.
- **Sound-Responsive Mode**: Alters light intensity with ambient sound.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Designed with energy conservation in mind.

## Future Work
- **Outdoor Adaptation**: Incorporating weatherproof features and solar power.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Developing an intuitive control application.
- **Smart Home Integration**: Expanding compatibility with IoT platforms.
- **Analytics Feature**: Adding usage data analysis for further efficiency.
