## Development Process
The development involved initial prototyping on a breadboard, with iterative coding and testing phases.
### Prototype on Breadboard

Here is an image of the initial prototype of our smart lighting system assembled on a breadboard:

*Description*: This image shows the early stage of our project where the components like the Arduino Uno, NeoPixel LED strip, and various sensors were first assembled on a breadboard for testing and development purposes.
Features developed include:
- Motion-activated lighting
- Sound-responsive light adjustment
- Temperature-based color change
The final design was assembled on a stripboard with a custom laser-cut enclosure.

## Product Features
- **Adaptive Brightness**: Auto-adjusts based on ambient light levels.
- **Motion-Activated Lighting**: Responds to occupancy for energy efficiency.
- **Color Temperature Adjustment**: Changes hues with room temperature.
- **Sound-Responsive Mode**: Alters light intensity with ambient sound.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Designed with energy conservation in mind.
## Video Demonstrations

### PIR and LDR Functionality
This video showcases the system's light and motion detection capabilities:
- Low ambient light triggers the light to turn on.
- Absence of motion leads to dimming the lights.
- Detection of motion brightens the lights again.
- High ambient light turns the lights off.
