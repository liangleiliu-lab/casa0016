# Arduino-Based Smart Lighting System

## Overview
This project involves the development of an Arduino-based smart lighting system that adjusts its behavior based on environmental inputs like motion, light intensity, sound levels, and temperature. The system aims to enhance user experience in indoor environments while promoting energy efficiency.

## Features
- **Motion Detection**: Activates lighting upon detecting movement.
- **Ambient Light Sensing**: Adjusts brightness based on surrounding light levels.
- **Temperature-Based Color Change**: Alters light color in response to ambient temperature.
- **Sound-Responsive Mode**: Modifies lighting intensity according to ambient sound.

## Test Codes
1. **fading test**: Demonstrates motion and ambient light sensing, since no motion detected, the brightness decrease to 10%.
2. **auto-adjust-Temperature-Based Color Change(mode 1)**: Showcases LED color changes with temperature variations and function within fading test.
3. **Sound-Responsive Mode(mode 2)**: Illustrates changes in brightness based on sound levels.
4. **Complete System Test(final code)**: Integrates all features for comprehensive system evaluation.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the system, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided sketches.
3. Connect the Arduino board to your computer and upload the sketch.
4. Observe the system's behavior in different environmental conditions.
