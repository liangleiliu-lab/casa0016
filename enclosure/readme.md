## Laser-Cut Enclosure Design

Included in this repository is a DXF file for laser cutting the enclosure of the smart lighting system. This file is designed to be used with a laser cutter to produce a precise and professional-looking case for the device.

### Usage Instructions:

1. **Download the DXF File**: Locate and download the `box_design.dxf` file from the repository.

2. **Prepare the Laser Cutter**: Ensure that the laser cutter is set up correctly and calibrated for the material you intend to use for the enclosure.

3. **Import the DXF File**: Open the DXF file in the laser cutter's software. This file contains all the necessary cutouts and dimensions for the enclosure.

4. **Material Selection**: Choose a suitable material for the enclosure. Typically, acrylic plastic or plywood is used for such purposes, but ensure it is compatible with your laser cutter.

5. **Cutting Process**: Use the laser cutter to cut along the design specified in the DXF file. Be sure to follow all safety procedures associated with the equipment.


### Customization:

- The DXF file can be modified to suit specific design preferences or to adjust dimensions, AUTOCAD is able to do the modification.
- If you make alterations, ensure that all components can still fit securely within the enclosure.
